We take *x* and *y* coordinates, the team name and information\nif goal was scored. If It was scored, we plot a solid circle with a name of the player, if not, we plot a\ntransculent circle (parameter alpha tunes the transcluency).\nTo have England's shots on one half and Sweden shots on the other half,\nwe subtract *x* and *y* from the pitch length and height.\n\nFootball data tends to be attacking left to right, and we will use this as default in the course.\n\n"
